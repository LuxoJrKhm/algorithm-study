# Algorithm & Data Structure Study

This repository is a personal collection of algorithms and data structures implemented in various programming languages. It serves as a practice ground and a reference for my learning journey.

## Languages

Currently, the repository contains solutions in:

## Project Structure

The project is organized by programming language. Inside each language directory, the structure is as follows:

```
language/
└── example/
  ├── AlgorithmType/          // e.g., sort, search, dp
  │   ├── AlgorithmClass.java // e.g., MergeSort.java
  │   └── question/           // Problems related to the algorithm type
  │       └── SiteProblemID.java  // e.g., Baekjoon2751.java
  └── Main.java
```

*   **AlgorithmType Package**: Contains the implementation of a specific algorithm type (e.g., `sort`, `graph`).
*   **AlgorithmClass**: A class that implements a specific algorithm.
*   **question Package**: Contains solutions to problems from online judges like Baekjoon, Programmers, etc., categorized under the relevant algorithm type.
